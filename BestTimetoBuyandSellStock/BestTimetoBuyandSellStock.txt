Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.


提示：
采用一维动态规划进行解答：
* 状态：代表什么以及如何找到它；用来描述该问题的子问题的解；
* 状态转移方程：描述状态之间如何转移；

具体方程：
dp[i]=max(maxprofit, p[i]-minprice)
