Happy Number:

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0 + 0 = 1

Hints: 如何判定是否存在环
1、每个首先计算各个位的平方和，如果不为1，则用hash记录；
2、把和当做步骤，重复步骤1，如果在hash中存在该记录，则为环，返回false;
