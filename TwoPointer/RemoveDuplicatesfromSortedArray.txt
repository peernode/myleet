Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
 
 Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory. 

For example,
 Given input array nums = [1,1,2], 

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length. 


提示：
1、two pointer
2、当出现重复的值时，不填充相应的位置，到下一个不一样的值时，把该值往前挪动；
